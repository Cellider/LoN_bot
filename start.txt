Hello there! This bot will serve as a general guide for Lord of Nazarick. I will help you with information about building characters and PvE content.

I was build by Cellider with the help of the MFTD community to help players with guides on the Lord of Nazarick game.

My prefix is: ..

List of commands (they are all case incentive, NAME = name):

- ..start --> You're on this page right now.

- ..entoma/cutetoma --> Entoma dance.

- ..build --> Guide about building each character.

- ..realm --> Guide about Realm or Shadows

- ..treasury --> Guide about Treasuries

I'm always open for suggestions or corrections, please ping Cellider.
